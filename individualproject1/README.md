Individual Project #1: Rust CLI
* Build a useful command-line tool in data engineering or machine learning engineering. 

 a Rust program that calculates the Intersection over Union (IoU) value for two rectangles defined by their coordinates, split into two files: main.rs and lib.rs. The program takes the coordinates as command-line arguments.
 
 
 
which will run 

```
cargo run --  10 10 20 20 4 10 20 20
```
Output:IoU value: 0.625
